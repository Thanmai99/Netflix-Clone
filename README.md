# Netflix-Clone
A React.js-based web application that mimics the Netflix platform, enabling users to browse and stream real-time movie data using the TMDb API.

## Key Features
- Real-time movie data fetched from **The Movie Database (TMDb) API**.
- Browse **Popular, Top-Rated**, and **Upcoming** movie categories.
- **Responsive UI** for smooth viewing across devices.
- Built using **React.js** for a dynamic and modular front-end experience.
- Netflix-like layout with interactive elements and hover effects.

## How It Works
1) **Input**:
    - Movie data retrieved from TMDb API (title, image, ratings, etc.).
   
2) **Processing**:
    - React components render categorized movie sections dynamically.
    - API calls update the interface in real-time based on fetched data.
    - Responsive layout adapts to different screen sizes for optimal UX.

3) **Output**:
    - Interactive Netflix-like UI where users can browse movies by category.
    - On-hover previews or modal overlays (optional based on features implemented).
